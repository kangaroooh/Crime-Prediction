# Text Mining Project

## Setting up development environment

make sure you have conda install in your environment, so that we can make sure we use the same versions of python, and libraries. Alternatively, use colab(https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EF5sANxEpaFrRXuWnSuSj5dXXwaRiMBx#scrollTo=98NDvVZOdRHj)

```sh
conda create -n txtmng-dev -f environment.yml
source activate txtmng-dev
```
